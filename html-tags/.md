## HTML Tags

HTML uses tags to define the structure and content of a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets < > and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.

#### Example:

```bash
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

- <p> – opening tag
- </p> – closing tag
- Content goes between the tags
